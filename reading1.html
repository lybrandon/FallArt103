    <b>Please provide answers to the questions below by the review date. Please use complete sentances.
      Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?
    </b>
    A: I believe that a good definition of a system is where a series of components that rely on each other and react congruently. A good example of this is the symetry and patterns of a Tesselation. There is a specific system or order for each
    individual tile to fit on the surface. A specific size and shape are required for the piece to be successful. This requires a great amount of planning and organizantional vision for a system to run smoothly. I would consider a system filled
    with flaws to not accurately depict a system. For example, if you do not have a specific order or flow in finishing your task, a new system in being more productive may be required.

    <b>Q2. -- For the 4 system definations you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.</b>
    Modularity : The use of standardized units that physically connect to each other to form larger compositions. A good example of this is a brick building. The entire building is made up of symmetrical bricks, stacked on top of each other to
    form a much larger object. If there was a problem with the structure, the bricks could be reconfigured, removed/added when needed.
    Decomposibility: This is the ability to be broken down into smaller components or into something that shares the same molecular structure it had before. A good example of this could be a banana. The peel will begin to change form and shape
    once it is exposed to air. When the banana decomposes, it is in a completely different state.
    Emergence: Is the appearance of patterns or intelligence appearing from the interactions of components at a granular level. A good example of this is human consciousness. There are specific ideas that are triggered by muliptiple understandings
    in your brain to help see something that may be unclear at first.
    Chaos Theory: This is a scientific theory that studies a branch of mathematics that were thought to believe to have completely random states of disorder yet still provide features of self familiarity and organization. An example of this is the
    butterfly effect. This is where a miniscule event could result is something with enormous proportion.

    <b>Q3. -- What is the difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other?
      A: In a way, Modularity and Tesselation sound extremely similar in the idea that they both refer to a construction of an object by joining together smaller components of something to create a much larger compostion. One major difference that
      I notice is Symmetry, which is an important factor is Tesselation. Depending on the type of Tesselation being constructed, the features being portrayed should be mirrored, congruent, rotated etc, all feature specific effects that on work
      together. Both ideas require a specific type of symmetry when being made.

    Q4. -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)
    A: The differerence between designing something with Complexity and Uniform is behind the nature one thing is being created in. Uniform is based off repetition throughout the whole piece when Complexity is more sporadic. Nothing is following
    the same pattern yet until it is perceived as whole. This pattern bring about change from the starting part.
    Q5. -- What is the difference between a system diagram and a some kind of feature diagram like a like a exploded view drawing or a illustration like this lady bug. Please explain in complete sentances.
    A: The main difference between the two diagrams is that one subject is living and the other is not. A system diagram depicts the components of a system and a exploded view drawing talks about what we see through our vision.
